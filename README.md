# qfind
A word-matching filter-based search engine for past paper questions and mark schemes.
## Goals
### Short term
- Redesign
- Better filter system
- Add more papers
- Multiple pages(home, search, help, about)
- Monetisation
- Advertising
### Long term
- My folder
- Accounts
- Mark calculator
- Paper search
## About
`qfind` allows users to search thousands of past paper questions by matching keywords or applying filters.
This functionality is available at the simple client-only webpage [lorcajheeney.github.io/qfind](https://lorcajheeney.github.io/qfind)
that connects to a database of questions generated by a `python` backend.

## How it works
Papers to be processed are stored in the `URL.txt` file, with different exam boards being seperated by headers and a paper consisting of a link
to both the paper and its markscheme on consecutive lines. Once the python program has read all of the papers in and filtered out previously processed papers
it used `curl` to grab the pdf file, converts the pdf file to html and then uses `regex` based searching to find the start of questions. The program also scans the first page of the paper
for important detail such as the module(M1,CH3 etc.), session(SUMMER or WINTER) and year. Once this information has been handled it writes new records into `PDFS.txt`.

## Database structure
`PDFS.txt` consists of records which are seperated by newlines and headers which denote the different exam boards, the fields are seperated by "@~" delimiter.
Record structure ->
